### Your name
Ignacio Vidal Vallejo

### What was challenging?
I ve found it a medium-high challenge. The logic after remove / add fruits, 
and how to display selected on both components, and on overflow box showing selected fruit (to describe),
burned me a little, because I haven 't found a perfect result, whereas I have tryed with .scroll methods.

### What did you enjoy doing?
Vuex is amazing, I enjoy using it.


### If you had more time, what would you improve/do differently?
I would implement little arrows on fruit chooser to execute scroll. 
I also would implement a scroll-to-active-fruit logic, to select both active fruit and the description of the active fruit at time.
At the moment, it is not really adjusted after addition / deletion of fruits.

### How much time (more or less) it took you to complete the task?
between 35-40 hours


### What do you think about the task itself? (Was it a good experience? If not why?)
As I told , I ve found it at a medium-high level of difficulty, and it was interesting for me.
